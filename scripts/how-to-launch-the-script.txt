STOPPING
- is a previous run running? if you see Google Drive/incoming/i-am-running.txt, then it probably is.
- to get the previous run to stop, in Google Drive/incoming/, touch stop-please.txt
- the xml2pdf-sleep.jsx script should notice that .txt file after a minute and shut down gracefully.
- if the script is hosed it won't pick that up, so Force Quit it after a minute.

STARTING
- switch to InDesign
- locate the Scripts panel – it should already be open. it's the one that has a big S on it.
- double-click xml2pdf-sleep.jsx
- you will receive confirmation in the form of a dialog box.
- you can try to make the dialog box go away but clicking on the button will probably have no effect.
